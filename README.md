# # Project 02 - SoundBloom 

My program creates a digital garden based on songs you input. In the input box, you will submit a song,
which the Spotify API guesses what song that is using its algorithm. Then, a flower will bloom and wither quickly
as it will expell seeds. You can keep adding new types of flowers by inputing more songs. Your mouse also
acts as wind for the seeds. 

I used a particle system, similar to my project 2 but I modified it to use the 
song's data. I used the particle system to expell seeds, and mimic wind. I also used Spotify's API to 
retrieve song data. Each song is designed based on the song's audio analysis from Spotify's database. 
Some attributes I used was the scores for danceability, energy, valence, and tempo. 

The inspiration behind this idea is that I'm very fascinated by music's ability to create a mood. It's similar to visual art. I wanted to reflect the mood of songs through visual arts. It was rather interesting using data
from Spotify's API because music and art is seen as an emotional creation. Meanwhile, the data is numbers but I used those generalized scores to create another mood through a new art medium. 

Reccomended songs: 
* Weird Fishes by Radiohead
* Let's Dance by David Bowie
* Last Nite by The Strokes
* Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chilli Peppers 

## Reflection

### What have you gained by completing this project?
I have gained patience and passion. Based on my past experiences with projects, I knew I would come across
obstacles whether that is a bug or needing to research more or changing my idea. Patience really helped me
get this project developed. In addition, simplifying my idea and focuses on the foundational pieces increased my progress than being stuck on one detail. Also, this project was a great exercise to realize how many skills I've learned. In paticular, I believed I've improved in structuring my code and using multiple files. As for passion, this is one of my favorite ideas and I'm glad I was able to make it happen. Oftentimes, I have multiple ideas and they tend to be complex so I never truly finish them. However, I really enjoyed creating this program. Although it is simple, I believe I can expand and improve in various ways, which is exciting. Also, I believe this program would be fun to share around friends and share music you enjoy.
